 - Visual glitch when walking (more noticeable when walking into/neat walls)
 - Move Gacha game hitbox closer to center of summon pad
 - Second log on the right side of bottom pathway is skewd/off-center
 - Log hitboxes are asymetric (Some stop you from moving when huggin the wall, some do not)
 - Random hit boxes when huggin lateral walls, Sometime happens sometimes doesn't. (Possible Z clipping)

 - Signature move doesn't reduce on winning hit


*Suggestions*
 -- Clean settings layout by putting sliders on left top of screen.
 -- Make back button in settings smaller
 -- Add wait time and animation when entering Gacha (Later on ofc)
